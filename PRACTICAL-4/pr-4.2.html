<h1>Data Science</h1>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>

<p>Machine Learning involves algorithms and mathematical models, 
    chiefly employed to make machines learn and prepare them to adapt to everyday advancements. 
    In this, based on historical data patterns, 
    the machine can predict the outcomes for the future months or years. This is an application of machine learning.</p>
<h2>Big Data</h2>
<p>Big Data is essentially a special application of data science,
    in which the data sets are enormous and require overcoming logistical challenges to deal with them. 
    The primary concern is efficiently capturing, storing, extracting, processing,
     and analyzing information from these enormous data sets..</p>
<h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence that is possessed by the machines. 
    It is modeled after the natural intelligence that is possessed by animals and humans. 
    Artificial Intelligence makes the use of algorithms to perform autonomous actions. </p><br>

    Data science can be defined as a blend of mathematics, business acumen, tools, 
    algorithms and machine learning techniques, all of which help us in finding out the hidden insights or patterns 
    from raw data which can be of major use in the formation of big business decisions.
